## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(global.par = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=4, fig.height=2.67) 
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 1.1)) 
```

**Load the strawberry dataset, e.g.,**
```{r}
firmness= read.delim("http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2/data/StrawberryStorageRCBD.txt")
head(firmness)
```



```{r, results = "hide"}
Overall =  mean(firmness$Firmness)
SSTotal = var(firmness$Firmness)*(length(firmness$Firmness) - 1)
ControlMean = mean(firmness$Firmness[firmness$Storage=="Control"])
ModifiedAirMean = mean(firmness$Firmness[firmness$Storage=="ModifiedAir"])
AirMean = mean(firmness$Firmness[firmness$Storage=="Air"])
```


Overall mean firmness `r Overall`

SSTotal `r SSTotal`

Control Mean `r ControlMean`

Modified Air Mean `r ModifiedAirMean`

Air Mean `r AirMean`

We can continue this as was done in the Section 2.1 rmd file. But let's try generating a blocked anova table.


```{r}
unstacked= read.delim("https://prof.mkjanssen.org/asm/data/expl2_2_unstacked.txt")
head(unstacked)

varietymeans = (unstacked$Control+unstacked$ModifiedAir+unstacked$Air)/3
varietyeffects=varietymeans-Overall
3*sum(varietyeffects^2) # 3 because there are three observations in each block

```



ANOVA table
```{r}
anova(lm(firmness$Firmness ~ firmness$Storage + as.factor(firmness$Variety)))
```

Prediction equation
```{r}
summary(lm(firmness$Firmness ~ firmness$Storage + as.factor(firmness$Variety)))
```
