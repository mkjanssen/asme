<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><p>Experiments differ from observational studies in that the researchers are deliberately manipulating some values of the explanatory variable(s). Random assignment can allow cause-and-effect conclusions, while inclusion criteria give information about possible generalizations of the findings (as opposed to just requiring a random sample).</p><p>In addition to identifying sources of variation in a study, we want to quantify that variation. At this point, the standard error of the residuals gives us a way to start to quantify that variation. When we begin to consider two-mean models, we see the total error SSTotal partitioned as the sum of the model error SSModel (sum of squares for the model) and the Sum of the Squared Errors, the sum of the squares of the residuals.</p><p>In addition to the notion of practical significance, we want to determine if an observed statistic is <em class="emphasis">statistically significant</em>. This involves identifying a statistic of interest, null/alternative hypotheses, and asking: is the observed statistical likely to occur by chance alone?</p></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Mar-16.html#assemblage-5">in-context</a></span>
